LHANDER is a modern and minimal landing page site template. I has great features you would 
absolutely love. The template is mobile and retina ready, has hundreds of webfont icons, has
mailchimp integration and much more. Lhander has clean code and is very easy to customize. 
It's the perfect template to showcase your app products and services.

SUPPORT:
    
Since LHANDER is distributed for free, support is not offered. LHANDER is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the 
following tutorials:

 - http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/
 - http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include
jQuery in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials:
